Make Your Own Card Quiz: Lesson 4 - Google India Challenge Scholarship - Android Basics

## Steps 
1. Step 1: Draw your Card.
* Take a piece of paper. Think of someone you’d like to make a card for and sketch out a unique card design. It can be a birthday card, mother’s day card, congratulations card, just because card, halloween card, so on.

2. Step 2: Take a Picture of the Card.
* Take a picture of this card. You can use your phone’s camera to do this.

3. Step 3: Make your Card
* Then make the card, using all of the skills, views and view groups you’ve learned about in Lesson 1. Try to make your card in as simple and clear a way as possible, and to avoid using fixed widths or heights.

4. Step 4: Explain your Card
* Now it’s your turn to be the teacher. Take two minutes and record yourself explaining how you designed your card’s XML. You can do this with your phone’s video camera app.

* Explaining and communicating your design is not only an important skill for a burgeoning app developer, such as yourself, but it will also really help solidify the concepts you’re practicing.

5. Step 5: Share your Card

* When you’re done, post the before picture and the solution video to the Udacity forum entitled "Card Showcase" so that other students can practice and learn from your design.


The Card Showcase is meant to be a resource for new students to get additional practice. Feel free to like designs that are particularly cool and try coding up some of them yourself.
